explicit keyword?
design pattern
can inline as a static? --> Yes
can inline as a const? --> Yes
can static function as const?  --> Yes
can constructor be a virtual? --> No, when constructor execute that time vtable is not present
can virtual function as a const? --> Yes
pointer vs reference?
can we overide constructor & distructor? --> override constructor are allowed but override destructor not allowed
can we make virtual function as a static? No.
some of the questions on the copy constructor?

1. what is dangling pointer?
	when pointer is deleted;
	wild pointer = only pointer define, not declare, eg. int *p;
2. what is difference between macro and inline functions and constant ?	
	const is a keyword having scope , by using #define we can also replace name but using const we cant replace name.
3. diff const vs #define - > const is better bcz its having scope; #define is prepreocessor directive, where const is checked at compile  time, 
	pointer can assign to const variable.

Four Steps of Compilation: preprocessing, compiling, assembly, linking.

74. how many virtual table for class? vtable = number of class  and vptr= number of objects
			Each class will have its own virtual table.
			While each object has its own virtual pointer
75. design pattern in cpp? => Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, Behavioral Patterns, single tone, abstract
76. when overloading and overiding happnen? overloading happen at compilation time and overiding happen at runtime(virtual function)
77. what is enum class? in enum class, redeclaration is allow, changing value is allow
	enum classes - enumerator names are local to the enum and their values do not implicitly convert to other types (like another enum or int)
	Plain enums - where enumerator names are in the same scope as the enum and their values implicitly convert to integers and other types
78. what are the user defined data types in in cpp?
79. to call a macro of square of numbers with (3+1)  -> its depend on how u wrote a macro. this expression X is replace by the 3+1 
80. what is race condition and what is deadlock
81. what diff between pass by address vs pass by reference
	A pointer can be re-assigned while reference cannot, and must be assigned at initialization only.
	Pointer can be assigned NULL directly, whereas reference cannot.
	Pointers can iterate over an array, we can use ++ to go to the next item that a pointer is pointing to.
	A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. A reference has the same memory address as the item it references.
	A pointer to a class/struct uses ‘->'(arrow 
82. what is const member function
83. size of structure with 
	struct aniket
	{	short int a;	
		char b;
	} ==> 4 byte;
84. what is volatile data type?=> value may change without any modification, 
	it is used in multi-threading to make sure that the mulitple thread alwys see the lastest value
85. what is structure padding?
86. memory layout?
87. where static variable store and const? => static and const both are store in data segment
No, it will give redeclaration error, because argument are same, if we make different arguments , then it will compile
88. what is interface in cpp? --> its a abstract class
89. difference between reference and pointer in detail? 
90. swap ( *p, &a)
91. what is final class?
	final specifier in C++ 11 can also be used to prevent inheritance of class / struct. If a class or 
	struct is marked as final then it becomes non inheritable and it cannot be used as base class/struct. 
	class base final
	{

	};
	this base class wont be inheritance
92. is it possible to write recursive inline function? ==> yes its possible.
93. code segment mode?
94. static const function?
  	A 'const member function' is not allowed to modify the object it is called on, 
	but static member functions are not called on any object. It is used directly by scope
        resolution operator. Thus having a const static member function makes no sense, hence it is illegal.
        we can write that, it will compile, but writing make no sense.
95. #include "iostream"
	using namespace std;
	int main()
	{
    		int a[10];
		int *ptr = a;
		for(int i = 0; i<5 ; i++)
		{
		   *(ptr+i) = i;
		}
		cout<<*ptr++<<endl;    // 0
		cout<<(*ptr)++<<endl;   //1
		cout<<*ptr<<endl;       //2
		cout<<*++ptr<<endl;     //2
		cout<<++*ptr<<endl;     //3
	}
96. conversion of integerstring to integer--> stoi is api to do that, or   in a while loop    result = 10*result + (s[i] - '0');
97. find last nth element in single link list?
98. what is static vs dynamic binding?
99. what is linking error & compilation error?

102. when we crete object where memory get allocated ? --> stack/heap.
103. what is dynamic polymerphism? --> virtual function
104. diff between vector and list?
105. if (a &b)  if (a &&b)
why we need #ifndef and #endif  in header file-> when we include file in multiple cpp file ,
		 then it will create the entry multiple time to make it in a single time we used #define
106. when we create the pointer, where it exactly point?
107. do we need to write a destructor in cpp?
	The default destructor works fine unless we have dynamically allocated memory or pointer in class. When a class contains a pointer 
	to memory allocated in class, 
	we should write a destructor to release memory before the class instance is destroyed. This must be done to avoid memory leak.
108. REFERENCE VS POINTER
	to use smart pointer we need to use #include <memory>
	SMART POINTER  -> In smart pointer if we allocate memory using new then we dont need to worry about its deletion
	   unique pointer when get out of scope its get deleted automatically, we can not copy unique pointer
		
	  share_ptr -> when reference count become 0(i.e all pointer goes out of scope) its get deleted, it used memory from stack
		for unique pointer memory is allocated from stack
109. DELETE VS MALLOC
110. - why we need copy constructor of we are having default copy conmstructor? ==? default copy constructor do shallow copy
111. 	if(printf("hello") && printf("world"))
		{
			printf("X");
		}

		if(printf("hello") || printf("world"))
		{
			printf("Y");
		}


		if(printf("") || printf("world"))
		{
			printf("Z");
		}
112. - what is make file.
	 if we give core file, ? how will you get to know that this for which process? =>
 	 file < corefile_name > --> it gives binary name, for which core happened.

		HTTP1.1

		-- In HTTP1.1, there are 6 tcp connection are suppoerted by browser, but as the webpages are very big, now those are very less,
		-- every HTTP req is independent on previous and next req, so every they carry a header & some common data, cookies cache-control param
		-- keep alive is used to resuse tcp connection.

		HTTP2.0

		-- single http connection is being use, stream are used, in every stream is a req	
		-- compulsory to have TLS setup, 
		-- as a single tcp connection, so its faster
		-- multiplexing stream into the one
		-- header also can compress,
		-- if precedding req having same header data then it will not carry heder data for all req, it will cache
		-- its backword compatible to http1.1
