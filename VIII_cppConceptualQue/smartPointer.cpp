    /*weak_ptr
     A weak pointer is a smart pointer that does not take ownership of an object
     but act as an observer. In other words, it does not participate in reference counting 
     to delete an object or extend its lifetime. Weak pointers are mainly used to
     break the circular dependency that shared pointers create.
